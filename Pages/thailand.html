    <h1>Welcome to Thailand!</h1>

    <p>
        Thailand is a Southeast Asian country. It's known for tropical beaches, opulent royal palaces, ancient ruins and ornate temples displaying figures of Buddha. In Bangkok, the capital, an ultramodern cityscape rises next to quiet canalside communities and the iconic temples of Wat Arun, Wat Pho and the Emerald Buddha Temple (Wat Phra Kaew). Nearby beach resorts include bustling Pattaya and fashionable Hua Hin.

        <li><strong>Capital City:</strong> Bangkok</li>
        <li><strong>Population:</strong> Approximately 70 million</li>
        <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Thailand's climate is influenced by monsoon winds that have a seasonal character (the southwest and northeast monsoon). Most of the country is classified as Köppen's tropical savanna climate. The majority of the south as well as the eastern tip of the east have a tropical monsoon climate. Parts of the south also have a tropical rainforest climate.</li>
        <li>A year in Thailand is divided into three seasons. The first is the rainy or southwest monsoon season (mid–May to mid–October), which is caused by southwestern wind from the Indian Ocean.Rainfall is also contributed by Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and tropical cyclones, with August and September being the wettest period of the year.</li>
        <li>Winter or the northeast monsoon occurs from mid–October until mid–February. Most of Thailand experiences dry weather with mild temperatures. Summer or the pre–monsoon season runs from mid–February until mid–May.Due to their inland position and latitude, the north, northeast, central and eastern parts of Thailand experience a long period of warm weather, where temperatures can reach up to 40 °C (104 °F) during March to May, in contrast to close to or below 0 °C (32 °F) in some areas in winter.</li>
        <li>Southern Thailand is characterised by mild weather year-round with less diurnal and seasonal variations in temperatures due to maritime influences. It receives abundant rainfall, particularly during October to November.</li>

            <p id="fact1" class="hiddenFact">Home of the elephant!
                The Thai elephant (chang Thai) is the national animal of Thailand and has played an important part in the country’s history. National Thai Elephant Day is celebrated annually on March 13. The elephant was so important that it appeared on the flag of Siam and to this day still features on the ensign of the Royal Thai Navy. </p>

            <p id="fact2" class="hiddenFact">Buddhism is the main religion!
                The main religion in Thailand is Buddhism with an estimated 90-95% of the population identifying as Buddhists. Although it’s not compulsory, many Buddhist males will temporarily ordain as a monk during their lifetime. The period can range from a few days to a month or longer. The act of becoming a monk is believed to bestow merit on the man’s family. Although a boy or man can become a monk at any age, it is more common to do so before reaching the age of 20 or before getting married.</p>

                Bangkok is not just the capital and largest city in Thailand, but also has the distinction of having the longest name of any city in the world. The full ceremonial name of Bangkok is: Krung Thep Maha Nakorn Amon Rattanakosin Mahinthara Ayutthaya Mahidol Pop Noppharat Ratchathani Burirom Udomratchawiwet Mahasathan Amon Phiman Awatan Sathit Sakkathattiya Witsanukam Prasit.</p>

                The official language spoken is Thai. The standardised central Thai version is taught in schools nationwide and is spoken throughout Thailand. In addition to the official Thai language, there are also dozens of other regional languages and dialects. For example, in North Thailand people may use the local language, Kham Mueuang, when conversing with friends or family, but may use central Thai on other occasions.</p>

    <h2>Top 5 Places to Visit:</h2>
    <ul class="top-places-list">
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/thailand/best-places-to-visit-thailand"><strong>1. Chiang Mai</strong></a>
            <p>A 90-minute flight north of Bangkok, Thailand’s second city, Chiang Mai, remains resolutely everything that Bangkok is not: smaller, cooler, artier, ringed with verdant temple-topped hills and bursting with beautiful and distinctive wooden buildings. Stay on the quiet eastern edge of town for the better spa hotels with dreamy Ping River views. Browse the craft and night markets and wander round the wooden temples (Wat Chedi Luang is laced in filigree carving every bit as riotous as Versailles’ rococo). Wake early to watch saffron-swathed monks collect alms in the misty morning light around the mountain-top temple at Doi Suthep. Then make for the mountains — cooling hill-forest hikes have been a Chiang Mai staple since the 1970s.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/thailand/best-places-to-visit-thailand"><strong>2. Bangkok</strong></a>
            <p>Bangkok is a buzzing, baffling and mesmerising mix of ancient and modern, palaces and temples, gleaming skyscrapers and crowded alleys. Among the big-hitters, wander among the gilded roofs and ornate murals of the Grand Palace, the revered jade sage at adjacent Wat Phra Kaew (Temple of the Emerald Buddha) and the vast reclining Buddha at Wat Pho (make time for a traditional treatment at its respected massage school), then bar-hop or shop through the travellers’ enclave of Khao San Road.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/thailand/best-places-to-visit-thailand"><strong>3. Ko Khao Phing Kan</strong></a>
            <p>This toothy outcrop in the waters of Phang Nga Bay, northeast of Phuket, often goes by a more memorable moniker: James Bond Island. Ever since its starring role in the 1974 film The Man with the Golden Gun, it’s been a hit among visitors hoping to relive Roger Moore’s romps across beautiful beaches with Britt Ekland, and following the trail of Christopher Lee’s evil assassin, Francisco Scaramanga, through dense jungle. The location is every bit as dramatic as it is in the film and a day-trip by boat is a serene way to experience it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/thailand/best-places-to-visit-thailand"><strong>4. Phuket</strong></a>
            <p>Thailand may have smaller, remoter islands, but it’s the largest island, Phuket, clinches it for diversity, from food to wildlife and serene sands to design hotels. The Pearl of the Andaman has long been a magnet for jet-setters and celebrities, who come to hang out in design-forward luxury hotels, be polished and pummelled in swanky spas and sip champagne cocktails on bright white yachts. It’s palm-fringed boulder-studded beaches are some of the best in Asia. Seek out Nai Harn, a swirl of turquoise Andaman Sea sweeping around a crescent bay; slender, silky-white see-and-be-seen Surin beach; and Layan with its cherry-red sunsets and cool beach clubs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/thailand/best-places-to-visit-thailand"><strong>5. Ko Phangan</strong></a>
            <p>These days, you don’t need a backpack and a kindly disposition towards mosquitos to immerse yourself in the Thai wilderness. Hidden in a quiet corner of Ko Phangan island and accessible only by boat, Haad Yuan’s half-moon of fine white sand comes with a savage, unkempt beauty — but without a hint of discomfort. It’s easy to get back to nature here: wake in your boutique villa to the sound of cicadas in the trees and waves beating on the beach; stroll a few metres along the sand to wave-sculpted granite rocks where a rainbow of reef fish greets snorkellers; or clamber up winding mountain paths that cut through the pristine forest immediately behind Haad Yuan, and you’ll soon find tinkling waterfalls and cool freshwater pools. Aim east for laid-back shores dotted with old-school beach bars, local seafood restaurants and a Jack Johnson soundtrack that make the Ko Samet vs Ko Phangan decision easier every time.</p>

    <h2>Tourism in Thailand:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tourism makes up about 6% of the country's economy. Prior to the pandemic, Thailand was world's eighth most visited country as per World Tourism rankings compiled by the United Nations World Tourism Organization. In 2019, Thailand received 39.8 million international tourists, ahead of United Kingdom and Germany and received fourth highest international tourism earning at 60.5 billion US dollar.</li>
        <li>Thailand was the most visited country in Southeast Asia in 2013, according to the World Tourism Organisation. Estimates of tourism receipts directly contributing to the Thai GDP of 12 trillion baht range from 9 per cent (1 trillion baht) (2013) to 16 per cent. When including the indirect effects of tourism, it is said to account for 20.2 per cent (2.4 trillion baht) of Thailand's GDP.</li>
        <li>Asian tourists primarily visit Thailand for Bangkok and the historical, natural, and cultural sights in its vicinity. Western tourists not only visit Bangkok and surroundings; many travel to the southern beaches and islands. The north is the chief destination for trekking and adventure travel with its diverse ethnic minority groups and forested mountains. The region hosting the fewest tourists is Isan. To accommodate foreign visitors, a separate tourism police with offices were set up in the major tourist areas and an emergency telephone number.</li>
        <li>Thailand ranks fifth biggest medical tourism destination of inbound medical tourism spending, according to World Travel and Tourism Council, attracting over 2.5 million visitors in 2018. The country is also Asia's number one. The country is popular for the growing practice of sex reassignment surgery (SRS) and cosmetic surgery. In 2010–2012, more than 90% of medical tourists travelled to Thailand for SRS.</li>
