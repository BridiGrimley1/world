    <h1>Welcome to Thailand!</h1>

    <p>
        Thailand is a Southeast Asian country. It's known for tropical beaches, opulent royal palaces, ancient ruins and ornate temples displaying figures of Buddha. In Bangkok, the capital, an ultramodern cityscape rises next to quiet canalside communities and the iconic temples of Wat Arun, Wat Pho and the Emerald Buddha Temple (Wat Phra Kaew). Nearby beach resorts include bustling Pattaya and fashionable Hua Hin.

            <h2>About Thailand:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Capital City:</strong> Bangkok</li>
        <li><strong>Population:</strong> Approximately 70 million</li>
        <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Thailand's climate is influenced by monsoon winds that have a seasonal character (the southwest and northeast monsoon). Most of the country is classified as Köppen's tropical savanna climate.[73] The majority of the south as well as the eastern tip of the east have a tropical monsoon climate. Parts of the south also have a tropical rainforest climate.</li>
        <li>A year in Thailand is divided into three seasons. The first is the rainy or southwest monsoon season (mid–May to mid–October), which is caused by southwestern wind from the Indian Ocean.Rainfall is also contributed by Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and tropical cyclones, with August and September being the wettest period of the year.</li>
        <li>Winter or the northeast monsoon occurs from mid–October until mid–February. Most of Thailand experiences dry weather with mild temperatures. Summer or the pre–monsoon season runs from mid–February until mid–May.Due to their inland position and latitude, the north, northeast, central and eastern parts of Thailand experience a long period of warm weather, where temperatures can reach up to 40 °C (104 °F) during March to May, in contrast to close to or below 0 °C (32 °F) in some areas in winter.</li>
        <li>Southern Thailand is characterised by mild weather year-round with less diurnal and seasonal variations in temperatures due to maritime influences. It receives abundant rainfall, particularly during October to November.</li>

            <p id="fact1" class="hiddenFact">Coffee rules!
                Vietnam is the world’s second largest coffee-producing nation after Brazil, producing 16% of the world’s total coffee (Brazil’s is 40%). I found the coffee in Vietnam incredibly tasty, cheap, and the iced version is a refreshing drink to cool you down during the warm, humid months.</p>

            <p id="fact2" class="hiddenFact">Vietnam has the world’s largest cave!
                The cave, Son Doong, was discovered in 1991 in the Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park, near the Laos border. It measures more than 5 kilometers (3 miles) in length, and is 200 meters (656 feet) high and 150 meters (492 feet) wide. It also has a 60-meter-high calcite wall inside renown as “The Great Wall of Vietnam”.</p>

            <p id="fact3" class="hiddenFact">Motorbikes rule in Vietnam!
                In 2013, Vietnam had 37 million registered motorbikes, compared to just two million registered cars. Generally, only the wealthy own cars. Vehicle taxes are so high (100 to 200 percent) that motorbikes and other alternatives to cars are appealing.</p>

            <p id="fact4" class="hiddenFact">The national language is Vietnamese!
                Close to 80 million people speak the Vietnamese language in Vietnam, and millions more speak it throughout Asia. Vietnamese is also widely spoken in Vietnamese communities in far distant countries like Canada, Czech Republic, and the United States. In fact, the U.S. has more than one million Vietnamese speakers. In Vietnam, English to Vietnamese document translations are often required by law firms and corporations. </p>

    <h2>Top 5 Places to Visit:</h2>
    <ul class="top-places-list">
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-places-to-visit-in-vietnam"><strong>1. Phu Quoc</strong></a>
            <p>Best for beach lovers - About as far south as you can get from Hanoi without splashing into the Gulf of Thailand, the island of Phu Quoc is where beach worshippers come to pray. Lapped by jewel-blue waters and edged by fine sandy beaches, this is a place to slip into low gear, reaching for a cocktail as the ember-colored sun dips into the bay. But it’s far from undiscovered – local tourists come in droves for theme park thrills at VinWonders and giddying views over the sea from the world’s longest over-sea cable car. Phu Quoc is a popular stop for families, and if you fancy a change from the tourist scene, there are dense jungles to explore inland from the sand.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-places-to-visit-in-vietnam"><strong>2. Hanoi</strong></a>
            <p>Best for city slickers - Every trip has to start somewhere, and the ideal point of arrival for first timers is Vietnam’s historic capital. As well as easy infrastructure, inexpensive accommodation, world-class dining and more history than you’ll ever have time to take in, Hanoi is the leaping-off point for the islands and outcrops around Halong Bay and the forest-draped trails of the mountainous northwest. Give yourself time to graze through Vietnam’s catalog of street food treats, and pause to soak up the atmosphere in cozy cafes in the Old Quarter as well as rush around the sights.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-places-to-visit-in-vietnam"><strong>3. Lan Ha Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay</strong></a>
            <p>Best for iconic photos - The crowds mob Halong Bay but for our money, the shimmering bays to the north and south have a slight edge over Vietnam’s most famous collection of outcrops and islands. While trips to Halong Bay are highly commercialized, with motorized luxury junks blowing diesel fumes around the eroded karst islands, Lan Ha Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay are a bit more laid-back, and you won’t have quite so many cruise ships in your photos. Try kayaking between the outcrops, explore the tropical trails on Cat Ba Island – gateway to Lan Ha Bay – or kick back on the sand on Bai Tu Long’s idyllic Co To Island.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-places-to-visit-in-vietnam"><strong>4. Ho Chi Minh City</strong></a>
            <p>Best for a sense of the past - Cosmopolitan Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is the southern counterweight to Hanoi in the north, taking its cultural cues from the Mekong Delta and neighboring Cambodia. It’s fast-paced, frenetic and fun, particularly after dark, when the pavements transform into a mobile buffet of street food stalls and roadside bars. A little of the frontier feel of the war years lives on in HCMC, and you’ll get a humbling introduction to this troubled time at sites such as the War Remnants Museum. The ghosts of French Indochina linger too – set aside some time to wander past the city’s colonial-era landmarks, then settle into a coffee shop with a drip-brewed ca phi and consider how far Vietnam has come since the end of French rule.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-places-to-visit-in-vietnam"><strong>5. Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park</strong></a>
            <p>Best for unique experiences - Vietnam’s biggest natural attraction – literally – is Hang Son Doong cave, the largest cavern in the world by volume and a true wonder. An entire New York City block could fit inside its vast main passage, but this monster cavern is only accessible on expensive guided treks. The good news is that surrounding Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park is pockmarked with caverns that you can clamber, crawl, boat or zipline through for a fraction of the cost. Trips to the Tu Lan, Phong Nha and Paradise caves are possible on a shoestring budget; more cash will buy access to Hang En, where trekkers set up tents on a subterranean beach, illuminated by shafts of natural light.</p>

    <h2>Entry to Vietnam:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Visitors who are citizens of the following 41 countries can apply for an e-visa at Vietnam Immigration Department. The e-visa is valid for a single entry, for a maximum stay of 30 days and for the most common entrance and exit points which need to be specified on the application in advance (although it is unclear if this is enforced). Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China (Include Hong Kong and Macau, but except e-passport holders), Colombia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Denmark, East Timor, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Luxembourg, Myanmar, Mongolia, New Zealand, Netherlands, Norway, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay and Venezuela</li>
        <li>The cost of an e-visa is around 27 USD (the equivalent of 25USD payable in VND + about 2USD service fee for credit card processing). It has a lead time of 1-3 (Vietnamese) business days. There's no stamping fee due at the airport and you don't need to wait at the visa booth after landing. Head directly to immigration and clear passport control showing your printed e-visa paper. You'll get a stamp on your passport with the maximum allowed departure date.</li>
        <li>If your travel itinerary fits the restrictions of the e-visa it's by far the cheapest, fastest and safest option (as the whole process is government owned). The e-visa can not be extended, you will need to leave the country and return. Please don't confuse the e-visa with the visa on arrival which many times is incorrectly also called e-visa.</li>
        <li>Vietnam entry requirements: Visitors’ passports must be valid for at least 1 month after the date of arrival and have at least 2 blank pages for stamps given at the Vietnam border upon entry. The eVisa only allows a single entry to the country, so those who wish to leave Vietnam before the 30-day validity ends and then re-enter the country will be required to re-apply for an e-visa].</li>
        <li>Beware the extortion by Vietnamese Immigration officials at Saigon airport. Visitors arriving with a Tourist Visa purchased and approved by the government from their website may still be required to pay an additional fee ranging from USD 100 to 200 for "corrections" to their visa. Visitors who refuse to pay are detained in a locked, guarded room with no internet until they are able to arrange a flight back to their country of departure, on the same airline they used to fly to Vietnam. This can be very unpleasant, expensive and may take days to accomplish.</li>
